# HDP-WMM
Coding for paper "Bayesian Prognosis Analysis of Human Papillomavirus-Associated Head and Neck Cancer using Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Mixture Models", which has been accepted at IISE Transactions.

In this paper, we develop a novel hierarchical Dirichlet process Weibull mixture model (HDP-WMM) to study the prognosis of HNC patients given their HPV status. The HDP-WMM is capable of simultaneously characterizing the survival distributions of grouped data and capturing the dependence among different groups. Moreover, the HDP-WMM can identify clusters of patients based on their outcomes, providing additional information for exploring patient subtypes.
